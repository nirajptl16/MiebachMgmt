npm install

- Migrate database
-npm:run prisma:migrate

- Seed database with given seed.ts
npm run:prisma:seed

### Start backend server
npm run dev

3. Frontend Setup
cd Frontend
npm install 

### Start frontend server in another terminal 
npm run dev

[http://localhost:5173]

## üèóÔ∏è Design Choices & Trade-offs

### Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clean separation between business logic (services), data access (Prisma), and API routes (controllers)
- **RESTful API:** Standard REST conventions for predictable endpoints
- **JWT Authentication:** Stateless authentication for scalability

### Database Design
- **Decimal Types:** Used for money and hours to avoid floating-point precision issues
- **Cascade Deletes:** Configured to maintain referential integrity
- **Indexed Columns:** Added indexes on frequently queried fields (email, dates, relationships)

### Frontend Patterns
- **Context API:** For global auth state management
- **Custom Hooks:** `useAuth()` for cleaner component code
- **Protected Routes:** Middleware-style route protection
- **Optimistic UI:** Immediate feedback before API responses

### Trade-offs
1. **Forecast Hour Adjustment:** Currently decrements forecast hours when time is logged. In a real system, you might track "planned vs. actual" separately to preserve original estimates.

2. **Invoice Storage:** Generated dynamically on request rather than stored. Storing invoices would enable audit trails but adds complexity.

3. **Real-Time Updates:** Currently requires manual refresh. WebSocket integration would provide live updates but increases infrastructure complexity.

4. **Validation:** Basic validation on the frontend and backend. Production would need more comprehensive validation (e.g., preventing overlapping tasks, budget overruns).

5. **Error Handling:** Generic error messages for simplicity. Production would need detailed error codes and user-friendly messages.
